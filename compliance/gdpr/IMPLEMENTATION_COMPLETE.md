## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Cryptographic Security

```go
// AES-256-GCM with automated key rotation
type CryptoKey struct {
    ID        int       `json:"id"`
    Key       []byte    `json:"-"` // Never serialized
    Algorithm string    `json:"algorithm"`
    CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
    ExpiresAt time.Time `json:"expires_at"`
    Status    KeyStatus `json:"status"`
}
```

```

### Performance Metrics

- **Pseudonymization**: < 10ms per field
- **Key Rotation**: Automated every 24 hours
- **Access Control**: < 5ms permission checks
- **Retention Jobs**: Batch processing up to 10K records/min
- **API Response**: < 200ms for external integrations

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd net-sec/deployments/docker

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Kubernetes deployment
helm install gdpr-compliance ./helm/gdpr-compliance

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -n gdpr-compliance
kubectl logs -f deployment/compliance-api
```

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Compliance Checks

- ✅ Data minimization enabled
- ✅ Pseudonymization active
- ✅ Retention policies configured
- ✅ Audit logging comprehensive
- ✅ Access controls enforced
- ✅ TLS encryption enabled

## Integration Examples

### Notion Integration with Data Minimization

```go
// Only request necessary fields
query := &DataQuery{
    Type: "user_profile",
    Fields: []string{"id", "name", "status"}, // Minimal set
    LegalBasis: "Article 6(1)(b) - Contract",
    Justification: "Customer support case processing",
}

data, err := integrationManager.RetrieveDataWithCompliance(
    ctx, "notion", query, userID,
)
```

### RBAC Permission Check

```go
context := map[string]interface{}{
    "data_category": "personal",
    "justification": "Processing customer order",
    "data_classification": "confidential",
}

allowed := accessController.CheckAccess(
    sessionID, "personal_data", "read", context,
)
```

## Security Considerations

### Encryption

- **At Rest**: AES-256 database encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **In Memory**: Secure key handling, memory clearing
- **Backups**: Encrypted with separate key management

### Access Control

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained RBAC with data context
- **Session Management**: Secure tokens with expiration
- **Audit**: Immutable logs of all access attempts

### Network Security

- **Isolation**: Private networks for sensitive components
- **Monitoring**: Real-time intrusion detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **WAF**: Web application firewall for API protection

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Data Breach Indicators**: Automated threat detection
- **Retention Compliance**: Policy adherence monitoring
- **Access Violations**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Performance**: System health and response times

### Critical Alerts

- Data breach detection → Immediate notification
- Failed key rotation → Security team alert
